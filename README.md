# SPACEDOS03

SPACEDOS03 is open-source semiconductor particle detector (dosimeter and spectrometer) for space applications. Detector is based on silicon PIN diode. The Detector is designed as autonomous for long-term measurement campaigns and therefore contains its own power source from high-capacity battery cells and a recording medium in the form of an industrial SD card. The device is designed to be able work for half a year continuously.

The detector is mounted into a 3D printed box that contains spaces for passive TLDs and track detectors.
