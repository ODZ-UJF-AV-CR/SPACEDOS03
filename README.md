# SPACEDOS03

SPACEDOS03 is semiconductor particle detector (dosimeter, spectrometer) for space applications. Detector is based on silicon PIN diode. The Detector is designed as autonomous and therefore it contains own power source from high-capacity primary cells and a recording medium in the form of an industrial SD card. The device is designed to be able work for half a year.

The detector is mounted into a 3D printed box that contains spaces for the TLD and detectors.
